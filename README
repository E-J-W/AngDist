Angular Distribution Calculator
Maintainer: Jonathan Williams

Calculates the directional distribution for gamma radiation emitted from an axially symmetric oriented source.  In part based on g77 code by K. Starosta for gamma-gamma angular correlations.

INSTALLATION

Use 'make' to compile.  Tested and seems to work with gfortran on Ubuntu 14.04 and Scientific Linux 6.  Requires libmathlib (in the 'cernlib' package on Ubuntu 14.04 and SL6).
If on SL6, you may need to replace the LIB line in the Makefile with:
LIB = /usr/lib64/cernlib/2006/lib/libmathlib.so.2_gfortran

Porting from g77 to gfortran compatible code:

-used -std=legacy flag to supress warnings
-used -ffixed-line-length-none to avoid errors caused by lines that go over the default 72 character limit
